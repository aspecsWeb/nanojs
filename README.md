# NanoJS

NanoJS is a lightweight and robust JavaScript framework built on **web components**. With no external libraries required, NanoJS enables you to build modular websites, that run everywhere, while keeping performance at its core.

## Key Features

- **Native Web Components**: Utilize browser-native features without the need for additional libraries.
- **TypeScript Support**: Enhance your development experience with static typing and cleaner code structure.
- **SCSS for Styles**: Modular and maintainable styles with support for SCSS, allowing you to write clean and reusable styles for your components.
- **Modular Architecture**: Keep components self-contained and reusable with a structure inspired by frameworks like Angular.
- **Lightweight**: No large runtime libraries or dependencies, ensuring fast load times and optimal performance.

## Project Goals

1. **Lightweight**: No external dependencies or libraries.
2. **Robust**: Well-structured code with TypeScript, offering a scalable foundation.
3. **Native**: Built using native browser technologies such as ES Modules and Web Components.
4. **Modular**: Components are self-contained with separate HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript files.
